Even experienced riders may forget their compass card every now and then. The problem is that to learn how to use Translink, get a ticket or compass card, and fill up the funds of the card could sometimes be in different places. You would have to use different apps and go to different locations. Our app aims to solve that problem. '

This would allow experienced riders to continue using Translink without losing time in case they are missing their compass card or if they are going to a place they are not familiar with. This would also allow new travelers to easily learn how to navigate through Translink with one convenient application.
