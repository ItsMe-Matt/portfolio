The problem is that to learn how to use Translink, get a ticket or compass card, and fill up the funds of the card could sometimes be in different places.

A good example would be the tappable NFC card. During the initial research, I found that Translink had no intention of releasing a Compass API or making the card digital. Because of that, we had to redesign some of our pages and components to fit, not only what we had, but what we could also handle skill-wise. During the Development stage, I designed a website on wordpress to track our progress and share details regarding the app and the team. Unfortunately, due to limited funds, the website was taken down earlier in 2022. I also designed the business cards at this stage. I also prepared for usability testing but that was also cut out due to time restraints.'
